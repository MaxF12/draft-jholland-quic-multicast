                      Multicast Extension for QUIC
                  draft-jholland-quic-multicast-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a multicast extension to QUIC to enable the
   efficient use of mullticast-capable networks to send identical data
   streams to many clients at once, coordinated through their individual
   connections to the same service.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension to QUIC version 1 [RFC9000] to
   enable the use of multicast transport of identical data streams from
   a set of sending servers to potentially many individual clients on
   many individual connections while making efficient use of multicast-
   capable networks.

   This proposal tries to reuse as much as possible from [RFC9000] and
   [I-D.draft-ietf-quic-multipath].

   The multicast data can only be consumed in conjunction with a unicast
   QUIC connection.  When support for multicast is negotiated, the
   server can optionally advertise existence of one or more multicst
   channels that contain unidirectional data streams from server to
   client, and the client can optionally join the multicast channel,
   confirm to the server that correct data is being received, and cut
   over to simply checking the integrity of the multicast data via
   authentication anchors sent over the unicst connection and
   acknowledging the data from the multicast channel(s) over the unicast
   connection.

   This document does not define any multicast transport except server
   to client.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

10.  Security Considerations

   Mostly incorporate draft-krose-multicast-security.  Anything else?

   e.g. if a different legitimate quic connection says someone else's
   quic multicast stream is theirs, that's maybe a problem worth
   protecting against.  Maybe we need a periodic asymmetric challenge?
   I'm thinking send a public key on the multicast channel and in the
   unicast channels send a MAC signed with the private key, so that in
   addition to validating that the unicast sender knows the contents of
   the multicast packets via an AMBI-like hash, the multicast stream
   provides a way to prove that the unicast stream is authorized to use
   it for data transport via proof they know the channel's private key.
   (Note this doesn't prevent unauthorized receipt of multicast data
   packts, but does prevent a quic server from lying when claiming a
   multicast data channel belongs to it, preventing legit receivers from
   consuming it.)
